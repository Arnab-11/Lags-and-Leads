# Lags-and-Leads

# How to create "lags" and "leads" of a column in a pandas DataFrame

In Python, the ***pandas*** library includes built-in functionalities that allow you to perform different tasks with only a few lines of code. One of these functionalities is the creation of lags and leads of a column.

- ***lag*** shifts a column down by a certain number.
- ***lead*** shifts a column up by a certain number.

## *Method*

In this method, we first initialize a pandas dataframe with a numpy array as input. Then we select a column and apply lead and lag by shifting that column up and down, respectively.
